# MealKart Food App

The idea for this project is to build an **Online Food Delivery (MealKart) Mobile Application** that can facilitate online food delivery from local restaurants to your Dining Table through your Smartphone in just a few clicks. The main objective of the project is to make a centralized system for all the customers so that they can check the details of Food Items, Categories, special offers & discounts from different Restaurants. 

Users can book their Orders, and can pay electronically. It will help Restaurant manage all the information about their Food Item list, their collected Payment from customers, Confirm Orders, etc. It will also help the delivery company to collaborate in real-time with restaurants and customers.


# Motive Behind MealKart

Food delivery market in India worth over 12.5 billion, Online food delivery is contributing more than 7% to this market. More than 50,000 restaurants in India provide home delivery, indicating a very high potential and untapped market in the online food delivery space. And this is the very reason I had chosen this use-case for my mobile application.

## Vocal for Local

*"Empowering Restaurant and Food-chain Business of my Local Community "*

There comes an important question that, what is the need of making a food delivery app as there are already many popular brands running very successfully like Zomato, Swiggy?

## Debunk Monopoly

*"Monopoly becomes dangerous if there is no contender to challenge them"*

If popular Food Delivery Giants does not get any competition in their business, they will exploit us to maximize their profit, hence monopoly will lead to decline in food quality and reduce human values and honesty.

## To Learn & Explore

*"Mobile App Development is a hot cake in todayâ€™s time."*

There would also be an increased number of mobile app development companies in developing countries. Hence it is worthwhile to learn mobile application development as a highly rewarding skill.
